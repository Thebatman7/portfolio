	<h1>About Rembrand Pardo:</h1>
  	<p>Hello, <br/>
	Thank you for visiting. I love learning new things and traveling. I am from Spain and I speak three languages. Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University. Prior that, I finished an Associates in Business at Salt Lake Community College. I love teaching myself things and I have an entrepreneurial spirit. I love giving my best at everything I do. I'd love to work for a company and help it grow and learn new things as I do it. My goal is to one day start my own business and create foundations to help people in the world.</p>
 
        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <p>This is my third year at BYU. I have worked on some projects for my different CS classes.</p>
 	<ul>
                <li>I worked on a app project for CS 240 class. The app used google maps to pin different information around the world.</li>
                <li>I worked on another android app project for my CS 340 class. I used AWS and lambdas to optimize my app.</li>
                <li>While I was doing my intership for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eduction Department I worked on tools that help the leaders of the church orginze and manage meetings and different callings.</li>
 	</ul>
